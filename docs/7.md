# Polish and Innovation :sparkles:

## Innovation:
- Make **The Cat** 3D model.
- The animated earth rotation, its to simulate what happens in real life instead of a static earth model
- Created moon dust particles with a strobing effect to use light in a unique way.
- Incorporated lore into the game, the objective may be clear - but the underlying story is not so obvious.
