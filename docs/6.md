# Design Decisions :thinking:

## Beginning Stages:

Well many in our group love cats so we decided to make a cat a prominent character in the game.
- **The Cat** is the one who tells the player what to do, essentially a mysterious sage like figure.

We went with the space theme as it seemed like a really cool setting for our story and our mysterious Cat.

Initially we were thinking of doing a more puzzle solving game - but then we agreed on a more "finding/collecting" sort of game. We decided to add an oxygen meter which would decrease over time so as to add challange to our game.

We decided to make a custom cat model as it would be easier then finding an external model that would fit our great **The Cat**'s asthetic.

- **The Background** Due to the setting being in space, a background with the stars and the milky galaxy was appropriate, naturally this contains the sun and a view of earth from the moon! It adds a sense of realism to the scene.
