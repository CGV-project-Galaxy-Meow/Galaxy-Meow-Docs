# Challenges and Improvements :hammer_and_wrench:

3D Cat Model
- The cat model was a complex model as it had many parts to it that needed to be structured so as to resemble a cat.
- The texture of the cat was difficult to get as image textures were not mapping well onto it so we opted for a custom painted texture.

Collision
- Creating collision between the astronaut and 3D models in the scene was a challange.
