# Challenges and Improvements :hammer_and_wrench:

3D Cat Model
- The cat model was a complex model as it had many parts to it that needed to be structured so as to resemble a cat.
- The texture of the cat was difficult to get as image textures were not mapping well onto it. Thus, we opted for a custom painted texture.

Collision
- Creating collision between the astronaut and 3D models in the scene was a challenge. The astronaut could force there way through the the 3D models from certain spots which was an edge case that was hard to fix.

Raycasting
- Creating a raycasting function that could be used for any object or model was challenging, in terms of understanding the meshes which would intersect with the mouse click, this was overcome by refining what exactly was being clicked and identifying it correctly in debug statements. 

Modularity:
- At first it was hard to remove some of the aspects that were so bound to the game like the health related functions, but we figured it out.

First Person Mode:
- It was challanging to add first person mode as it conflicted with how we set up our object interaction system. We had to add an **E** to interact feature.
