## Player Movement and Interactions in Galaxy Space Odyssey

### 1. Player Movement on the Moon and Asteroid 

#### Movement Controls
- *WASD*: The player can move using the WASD keys.
- We will use KeyboardEvent listeners to detect and respond to keypresses for controlling the player’s movement.

#### Physics Simulation
- We will integrate physics libraries such as *Cannon.js* or *Ammo.js* to simulate *gravity* and *collisions* with the objects.


#### Smooth Camera Control
- Attach a *THREE.PerspectiveCamera* to the player object for a third-person view.
- As the player moves, the camera follows the player, maintaining smooth transitions and ensuring the player remains centered in the viewport.

### 2. Space Movement (Zero Gravity)

#### Zero Gravity Movement
- In space, we will implement *six degrees of freedom* for the player’s movement:
  - *Forward/Backward*
  - *Up/Down*
  - *Left/Right*
  
#### Quaternion-Based Rotation
- Use *quaternions* to handle smooth, free-space rotation.
- Map keyboard inputs to control both the player’s translation (movement) and rotation, allowing for realistic space movement with no fixed axis.
  
### 3. Interacting with Objects (Parts & Crystals)

#### Object Interaction
- Use *raycasting* from the player or camera to detect when the player is aiming at or looking at an interactive object (e.g., parts or crystals).
- When the player is targeting an object, allow them to press a designated key to *pick up* or *interact* with the object.
- Raycasting ensures that the interaction is precise and only occurs when the player is in range and facing the object.
