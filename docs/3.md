#### **The Cat** creation process

To aid in the modelling process a tutorial was followed: https://blenderartists.org/t/easy-sculpting-tutorial-cat-new/1445277
The model was created in blender.

Step 1: Create the basic cat shape
- Use basic shapes (ovel for body, circuler shape for the hips, ovels for the paws and legs, spehere for the head and circular shapes for the ears).

Step 2: Refine the features through sculpting
- Useing blenders array of sculpting tools (specifically the 'grab' and 'draw sharp' sculpting tools), the models body was refined to more closely resemble a cat.

- Using smaller spheres - eyes were created.

- The final sculpture looked like:

Step 3: Add the texture
Initially I tried to use an image texture. Getting an image to fit the model was quite difficult as there would be repeats in the texture. 
So instead I created a custom paintend texture by unwrapping the model and letting blender create a texture map.

The final outcome looked like:

#### Level 1 - Decorating the level
Using custom positions the map was decorated with various rocks. The scale and the rotation of most of the rocks will be random each refresh.
- A spaceship model was rotated and positioned to look as if it had crashed on the surface.
- A comet model was rotated and positioned to look as if it had crystalised on the moons surface.
- A 'ruins' model was positioned on the surface.



  
### Textures
- The asteroid and moon floor will have textures to resemble a rough ground.
- The textures for the stars and planets are from: https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/ 
- The cat model employs a custom painted texture:

## Level 1 Environment

Level 1 is set on the moon's surface with the background being Earth, Neptune Jupiter, the Sun, and some stars.

### Moon Surface Model
To create the realistic lunar landscape for Level 1, we integrated a detailed moon surface model sourced from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/moon-petavius-crater-ce9c009b517b421eab8c8429b536382f), uploaded by [SebastianSosnowski](https://sketchfab.com/SebastianSosnowski). This model was carefully selected for both visual fidelity and performance optimization, helping establish the atmosphere of the game without sacrificing efficiency.

## 2-Dimensional Raster Graphics
There are many 2D raster graphics drawings to accompany the game and make it feel more polished.
