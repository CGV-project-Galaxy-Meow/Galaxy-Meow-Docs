# Game Structure and Hierarchy :building_construction:



## Game Modelling Hierarchy

This section outlines the **modelling hierarchy** used in our 3D game, built with Three.js. The hierarchical structure is essential for organizing, rendering, and managing relationships between objects in the game world.

### 1. Root Node: Game Scene
The root node is the **game scene**, which contains all game objects, cameras, and lights. It serves as the central point for rendering and updating the game environment.

### 2. Camera and Lights
- **Camera**: The camera follows the player or provides a third-person perspective. The camera can switch between different views as needed.
- **Lights**: The game uses multiple lights to illuminate the scene (ambient, point lights, etc.), which are children of the scene and may either move or remain static depending on the level.

### 3. UI Components
- **Dialogue Box**: A UI element for displaying game instructions and taking input (e.g., entering the player's name). It appears at the start and end of the game.
- **Oxygen Meter**: This UI element tracks the playerâ€™s remaining oxygen and decreases over time, influencing game decisions.

### 4. Player Character and Avatar
The player character is the primary interactive element:
- **Player Avatar**: This represents the player and moves around the scene.
- **Collision Detector**: Checks for interactions with in-game objects (e.g., teleporter parts or crystals).
- **Oxygen System**: The oxygen meter decreases as the player moves through the game, tracked as part of the player hierarchy.

### 5. NPC: The Cat Guide
- **Body (Parent)**: The base of the Cat, including head, limbs, and tail, which move independently as needed.
- **Head, Limbs, Tail (Children)**: These allow the Cat to be animated during interaction with the player.

### 6. Level 1: Moon Environment
- **Terrain (Parent)**: The surface of the moon, with rubble scattered around.
- **Rubble and Teleporter Parts (Children)**: The scattered objects the player interacts with to collect teleporter parts.

### 7. Level 2: Asteroid Environment
- **Asteroid (Parent)**: The floating asteroid environment in space.
- **Crystals (Children)**: Collectable crystals needed to recharge the teleporter.

### 8. Level 3: Space Environment
- **Space (Parent)**: A void environment where the player floats.
- **Broken Teleporter (Children)**: The teleporter is broken into parts, which need to be fixed to progress.

### 9. Epilogue: Earth Scene
After completing the final level, the player is presented with a scene representing Earth:
- **Background (Parent)**: A static image of Earth or a field.
- **Dialogue Box (Child)**: Displays the final message to the player.

### 10. Background

- **Starry Background**: The game features a starry background created using an image texture to simulate a vast universe. This texture is applied to a large sphere surrounding the game scene, giving the illusion of depth and space.

### 11. Celestial Bodies

- **Celestial Bodies**: The sun and the Earth were created using Three.js sphere primitives. The sun is represented as a larger sphere with a glowing texture, positioned to illuminate the scene.
- **Directional Lighting**: Directional light is used to simulate sunlight, providing realistic illumination to the celestial bodies and enhancing the overall atmosphere of the game.

This hierarchical structure ensures that each object in the game world is efficiently managed, interactive, and contributes to the immersive gameplay experience.
