# Game Structure and Hierarchy :building_construction:



## Game Modelling Hierarchy

This section outlines the **modelling hierarchy** used in our 3D game, built with Three.js. The hierarchical structure is essential for organizing, rendering, and managing relationships between objects in the game world.

### 1. Root Node: Game Scene
The root node is the **game scene**, which contains all game objects, cameras, and lights. It serves as the central point for rendering and updating the game environment.

### 2. Camera and Lights
- **Camera**: The camera follows the player or provides a third-person perspective. The camera can switch between different views as needed.
- **Lights**: The game uses multiple lights to illuminate the scene (ambient, point lights, etc.), which are children of the scene and may either move or remain static depending on the level.

### 3. UI Components
- **Dialogue Box**: A UI element for displaying game instructions and taking input (e.g., entering the player's name). It appears at the start and end of the game.
- **Oxygen Meter**: This UI element tracks the playerâ€™s remaining oxygen and decreases over time, influencing game decisions.

### 4. Player Character and Avatar
The player character is the primary interactive element:
- **Player Avatar**: This represents the player and moves around the scene.
- **Collision Detector**: Checks for interactions with in-game objects (e.g., teleporter parts or crystals).
- **Oxygen System**: The oxygen meter decreases as the player moves through the game, tracked as part of the player hierarchy.

### 5. NPC: The Cat Guide
- **Body (Parent)**: The base of the Cat, including head, ears, torso, limbs, and tail.
- **Head, Ears, Torso, Limbs,  Tail (Children)**: These are more primitive shapes to make up the more complex Cat shape.

### 6. Level 1: Moon Environment
- **Terrain (Parent)**: The surface of the moon, with rubble scattered around.
- **Rubble and Teleporter Parts (Children)**: The scattered objects the player interacts with to collect teleporter parts.

### 7. Level 2: Asteroid Environment
- **Asteroid (Parent)**: The floating asteroid environment in space.
- **Crystals (Children)**: Collectable crystals needed to recharge the teleporter.

### 8. Level 3: Space Environment
- **Space (Parent)**: A void environment where the player floats.
- **Broken Teleporter (Children)**: The teleporter is broken into parts, which need to be fixed to progress.

### 9. Epilogue: Earth Scene
After completing the final level, the player is presented with a scene representing Earth:
- **Background (Parent)**: A static image of Earth or a field.
- **Dialogue Box (Child)**: Displays the final message to the player.

### 10. Background

- **Starry Background**: The game features a starry background created using an image texture to simulate a vast universe. This texture is applied to a large sphere surrounding the game scene, giving the illusion of depth and space as defined by a `Skybox`.The starry texture was first applied to the `gameCanvas`, and then all other models, including the sun and Earth, were added on top of this background to create a layered visual effect.

### 11. Celestial Bodies

- **Sun**: The sun is represented as a larger sphere with a glowing texture, positioned to illuminate the scene.
- **Earth**: wasadded with appropriate texture maps and positioned relative to the sun to simulate its orbital placement.
- **Celestial Bodies**: The miscellaneous planets were created using Three.js sphere primitives. They were enhanced using texture images.
- **Directional Lighting**: Directional light is used to simulate sunlight, providing realistic illumination to the celestial bodies and enhancing the overall atmosphere of the game. The light angle was adjusted to ensure that objects were illuminated from the correct direction with the appropriate shadows.



## Adding Objects to the Scene
This section details how each object was added and positioned within the game scene.

### Adding the Background:

- The starry background was added first. This was done by creating a large, textured sphere that surrounds the entire scene. By attaching a starry texture to this sphere, we created the outer space environment in which all other objects were placed. The background texture was attached to the `gameCanvas`, forming the foundational layer of the scene.
- This background is made using the `Skybox` method, to simulate an endless bound of space.

### Adding the Sun:
- The sun was added onto the scene next using a sphere primitive. After creating the sun, we applied texture to simulate its brightness and glow. A directional light was added to simulate sunlight, and it was positioned to ensure it illuminated the rest of the objects, like the Earth. The sun was then positioned at a distance from the center of the scene to act as the primary light source.

### Adding the Earth:
- The Earth was created as a textured sphere using a realistic Earth texture map. It was added to the scene after the sun, and positioned at an appropriate distance from the sun to mimic its orbit. This positioning creates the impression that the Earth is part of the solar system, floating within the starry background.
- The earth is also animated, to show an animated 3D object in the scene.

### Adding Other Celestial Bodies:
- Additional celestial bodies were added in a similar manner. Each was represented using a Three.js sphere primitive with appropriate textures. These bodies were carefully positioned relative to the sun and Earth to maintain a coherent structure for the solar system.


### Setting Lighting and Shadows:
- A directional light was added to simulate sunlight coming from the sun. The light was positioned so that it cast realistic shadows on the Earth,any other celestial bodies and the primary astronaut and cat models.
- There is ambient light to provide the basic visibility of the objects in the scene.
- With the directional light, there are shadows cast on the models to react to it, to show the difference between the part facing the light and the part not facing it.

This hierarchical structure ensures that each object in the game world is efficiently managed, interactive, and contributes to the immersive gameplay experience.
