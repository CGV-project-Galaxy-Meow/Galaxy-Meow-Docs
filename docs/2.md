## Viewing

The game is viewed through a third person point of view. Therefore, our playable character (the astronaut) is visible at all times. Making use of third person point of view allows the player to move the camera 360 degrees, without having to move the playable character, which will aid the player in finding the needed objects.

The player will be able to control the direction of the viewport by moving the mouse. The player could also use the touchpad on their computer, however using a mouse is advised.
